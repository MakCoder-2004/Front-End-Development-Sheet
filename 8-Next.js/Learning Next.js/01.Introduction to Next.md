# Introduction to Next.js

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a **React-based web development framework** that enables developers to build fast, user-friendly, and scalable web applications. It is developed and maintained by **Vercel**, and is widely adopted for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications.

Next.js simplifies the process of building **server-rendered** React applications and provides a complete solution for building **full-stack web apps**.

## What is Next.js Used For?

Next.js is commonly used for:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **Full-stack development** (Frontend + Backend in one project)
- Building **SEO-friendly** web applications
- Creating **progressive web apps (PWAs)**
- E-commerce websites, blogs, dashboards, and more
- Rapid prototyping and production-ready apps

---

**Server-side rendering (SSR)** --> `async` / `await`
**Static-side rendering (SSG)** --> `use()` Hook component

## Advantages of Next.js

### ⚡️ Performance

- Supports **SSR** and **SSG** out of the box
- **Automatic code splitting** for optimized loading
- **Image optimization** with the `next/image` component

### 🔍 SEO-Friendly

- Since it supports SSR and static generation, search engines can easily crawl content.

### 📦 Built-in Features

- **File-system routing**: pages are created by adding files in the `pages/` directory
- **API routes**: backend endpoints within the same project
- **Middleware**: for request handling and authentication
- **Internationalization (i18n)** support

### 💡 Developer Experience

- Fast refresh for quick development
- TypeScript and ESLint support
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Excellent documentation and community support

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

- Optimized for **Vercel**, but works well on platforms like Netlify, AWS, and others
- One-click deployment from GitHub

## Key Functionalities

| Feature               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **SSR & SSG**        | Render pages on request or build time for speed and SEO |
| **Routing System**   | File-based routing with dynamic routes |
| **API Routes**       | Create RESTful endpoints using `pages/api` |
| **Image Optimization** | Resize, lazy load, and serve responsive images |
| **Middleware**       | Intercept requests and add custom logic |
| **Built-in CSS/SCSS**| Style using CSS Modules or global styles |
| **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** | Update static pages after deployment |

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that bridges the gap between frontend and backend development in a modern, scalable, and efficient way. Whether you're building a blog, a portfolio, or a complex e-commerce platform, Next.js provides the tools and flexibility you need to succeed.
