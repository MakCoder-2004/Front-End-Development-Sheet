# React Component Life Cycle ðŸŒŸ

## 1. Mounting ðŸŒ±
When a component is first added to the DOM, it goes through the mounting phase. This is like planting a seed and watching it grow into a plant. Here's what happens:
- **Constructor**: This is the first method that gets called when a component is instantiated. It's where you initialize the state and bind event handlers.
- **Render**: This method returns what the component should look like. It's where you define the JSX that will be rendered to the screen.
- **React updates DOM and refs**: After rendering, React updates the DOM and sets up any refs you might have.
- **ComponentDidMount()**: This is a special method that gets called after the component has been mounted. It's a great place to fetch data from an API or set up subscriptions.

## 2. Updating ðŸ”„
When a component's props or state change, it goes through the updating phase. This is like watering your plant and watching it grow bigger.
- **newProps/ setState()/ forceUpdate()**: These are the triggers that cause a component to update. When you change props or state, React knows it needs to re-render the component.
- **Render**: Just like during mounting, this method returns what the component should look like with the new props or state.
- **React updates DOM and refs**: React updates the DOM and refs again to reflect the changes.
- **ComponentDidUpdate()**: This method gets called after the component has been updated. It's a good place to handle side effects that depend on the new props or state.

## 3. UnMounting ðŸŒ¿
When a component is removed from the DOM, it goes through the unmounting phase. This is like pulling up a plant by its roots.
- **newProps/ setState()/ forceUpdate()**: These can also trigger unmounting if the component is no longer needed.
- **Render**: The component is rendered one last time before it's removed.
- **React updates DOM and refs**: React removes the component from the DOM and cleans up any refs.
- **ComponentWillUnmount**: This method gets called right before the component is unmounted. It's a good place to clean up any subscriptions or event listeners you set up in componentDidMount.

## Example Component ðŸŒŸ
Here's an example of a React class component that demonstrates the life cycle methods:

```tsx
import { Component } from "react";

interface Iprops {}
interface Istate {
  counter: number;
  products: any[];
}

interface IProduct {
  id: number;
  title: string;
}

export default class ComponentLifeCyclePage extends Component<Iprops, Istate> {
  
  // ** Component Life Cycle

  constructor(props: Iprops) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0,
      products: [],
    };
  }

  // TODO Fetching data from an API when the component mounts
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component is mounting ðŸŒ±");
    fetch("https://dummyjson.com/products")
      .then((res) => {
        if (!res.ok) {
          throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
        }
        return res.json();
      })
      .then((data) => {
        this.setState({ products: data.products });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching products:", error);
      });
  }

  // TODO Cleanup code for entering another page
  componentWillUnmount(): void {
    console.log("Component is unmounting ðŸŒ¿");
  }

  // TODO Updating the component when the state changes
  componentDidUpdate(prevState: Istate) {
    if (prevState.products !== this.state.products) {
      console.log("Products updated:", this.state.products);
    }
  }

  // ** Component Render
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-4">

        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">

          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
            {this.state.products &&
              this.state.products.map((product: IProduct) => (

                  key={product.id}

                >
                  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">{product.title}</h2>
                </div>
              ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
