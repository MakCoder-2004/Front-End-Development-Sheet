# React Basics

## Quick Start

- Use `rafce` to quickly create a React arrow function component.

### JS Rules

- You can only return one top-level element.
- Any element must include a closing tag.
- Component name must be capitalized.
- Expressions in JSX must be wrapped in `{}`.
- Use `className` instead of `class` for HTML elements.
- Use `htmlFor` instead of `for` for attributes.
- Self-closing elements must end with `/` (e.g., `<input />`).

### React Fragment

- Import `Fragment` from `react` to use it.
- Use `<Fragment>` or `<>` to wrap multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.

--- 

- We must first at the top `import { Fragment } from "react"` 
```tsx
    <Fragment>
        <span>Helloooo</span>
    </Fragment>
```

or We can use

```tsx
    <>
      <span>Helloooo</span>
    </>
```
