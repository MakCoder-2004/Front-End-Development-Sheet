## 🔍 What is Yup?

**Yup** is a JavaScript schema builder for **value parsing and validation**. It's often used with `react-hook-form` for declarative form validation.

### ✅ Why Use Yup?

- Clean and readable syntax  
- Works with objects and nested structures  
- Seamless integration with React Hook Form  

### 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install yup
```

### 🧪 Basic Usage
- This schema can be used with React Hook Form via the yupResolver as shown earlier.
  
```bash
import * as yup from 'yup';

const schema = yup.object().shape({
  name: yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  age: yup.number().min(18, "You must be at least 18"),
  email: yup.string().email("Invalid email").required("Email is required")
});

```
