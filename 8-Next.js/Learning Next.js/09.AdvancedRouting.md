# Advanced Routing in Next.js

Next.js offers powerful and flexible routing features. This guide covers advanced routing concepts with diagrams and examples.

## Parallel Routes

Parallel routes allow you to render multiple pages in parallel within a single layout.

### File Structure
```
app
├── layout.tsx
├── @team
│   ├── page.tsx
├── @analytics
    ├── page.tsx
```

### Example
```tsx
export default function Layout({ team, analytics }: { team: React.ReactNode; analytics: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <aside>{team}</aside>
      <main>{analytics}</main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Parallel Routes Use Cases
- Dashboards with multiple sections
- Split-view interfaces
- Multi-pane layouts
- Complex admin interfaces

### Independent Route Handling

Parallel routes support **independent loading and error states** for each section.

### Loading Example
- At URL: `localhost:3000/dashboard`
- "User Analytics" section shows a **Loading** state while other parts (e.g., Notifications, Revenue metrics) are unaffected.

### Error Example
- At URL: `localhost:3000/dashboard`
- If an error happens in the "User Analytics" section, it shows an **Error** state while the rest of the dashboard remains functional (e.g., Notifications still render properly).

## Unmatched Routes

Unmatched routes help handle paths that don't match any defined segment.

### File Structure
```
app
├── [...notfound]/page.tsx
```

### Example
```tsx
export default function NotFoundCatchAll() {
  return <h1>Oops! This route doesn't exist.</h1>;
}
```

## Conditional Routes

Conditional rendering based on logic like auth, feature flags, or A/B testing.

### Example in Layout
```tsx
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const isLoggedIn = checkAuth();
  return isLoggedIn ? children : <LoginPrompt />;
}
```

## Intercepting Routes in Next.js

Intercepting routes is an advanced routing mechanism that allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This is particularly useful when you want to display new content (like modals) while keeping your user in the same context.

### Convention Syntax
Intercepting routes use special syntax to determine how far "up" the directory tree to intercept from:

- `(.)` to match segments on the same level
- `(..)` to match segments one level above
- `(..)(..)` to match segments two levels above
- `(...)` to match segments from the root app directory

### Practical Usage

#### Modal Implementation
A common use case is implementing modals that appear over your current content without a full page navigation.

**File Structure**
```plaintext
app
├── feed
│   ├── page.tsx          # The feed page
├── (..)profile          # Intercepted profile route
    ├── [id]/page.tsx    # Profile page that can be shown as modal
```

**Implementation**
```tsx
// In feed/page.tsx
<Link href="/(..)profile/123">View Profile</Link>
```
When clicked, this will show the profile as a modal over the feed page rather than navigating away.

#### Other Use Cases
- **Quick Preview**: Show a preview of content without leaving the current page
- **Contextual Editing**: Edit an item while maintaining the parent view
- **Nested Navigation**: Maintain parent context while drilling into details

### How It Works
- The special folder syntax `( .. )` tells Next.js this is an intercepting route.
- When linked to, the route is rendered in place of the current layout's children.
- The URL updates but the parent layout remains intact.
- The back button closes the intercepted view and returns to the original content.

### Best Practices
- Use clear visual cues that content is modal/intercepted.
- Ensure proper focus management for accessibility.
- Provide clear ways to close/dismiss the intercepted view.
- Consider adding a backdrop to indicate layered content.

## 🔄 Parallel Intercepting Routes

Combine parallel and intercepting routes for advanced UI patterns.

### 📁 File Structure
```
app
├── layout.tsx
├── @modal
│   ├── (..)settings
│   │   ├── page.tsx
├── page.tsx
```

### 🧪 Example
```tsx
<Link href="/(..)settings">Open Settings</Link>
```
Settings will open as a modal, rendered in the @modal slot.

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Feature | Purpose | File Structure |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Parallel Routes | Render multiple views | `@slot/page.tsx` |
| Unmatched Routes | Catch all | `[...all]/page.tsx` |
| Conditional Routes | Dynamic logic | Inline in layout/page |
| Intercepting | Overlays like modals | `(..)/segment/page.tsx` |
| Parallel Intercepting | Modal inside slot | `@modal/(..)/page.tsx` |
