# 🐻 Zustand – React State Management Library

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable **state-management** solution for React applications. Created by **PMND**, the same team behind Jotai and React Three Fiber.

## 📦 Why Zustand?

* Minimal and flexible
* React-friendly with no boilerplate
* Global and local state management
* Doesn't rely on context providers
* Works with React Server Components and SSR

---

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
npm install zustand
# or
yarn add zustand
```

---

## 🧠 Basic Concepts

### 1. **Store**

The Zustand store is where your application's state lives.

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface StoreState {
  count: number
  increase: () => void
  decrease: () => void
}

const useStore = create<StoreState>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increase: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrease: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
}))
```

### 2. **Using the Store in Components**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import useStore from './store'

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const count = useStore((state) => state.count)
  const increase = useStore((state) => state.increase)
  const decrease = useStore((state) => state.decrease)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increase}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrease}>-</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## ✨ Features

* **Selectors** for optimized re-renders:

```tsx
const count = useStore((state) => state.count)
```

* **Middleware** support (e.g., persist, devtools, immer):

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface StoreState {
  count: number
  increase: () => void
}

const useStore = create<StoreState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      count: 0,
      increase: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
    }),
    {
      name: 'counter-storage'
    }
  )
)
```

* **Nested state and actions** are fully supported

---

## 🎓 Learning Tips

* Use selectors to avoid unnecessary renders
* Split stores by domain/module for scalability
* Combine with `zustand/middleware` for persistence and debugging

---

## ⚖️ When to Use Zustand

Use Zustand when you need:

* Simple global state (better than Context API)
* Scalable stores with low overhead
* Quick setup for projects or prototypes

Not ideal if:

* You need advanced effects handling (consider Redux Toolkit or React Query)
