# Layout in Next.js

**Layout** is a core concept in Next.js used to define common UI structures (like headers, footers, and sidebars) that persist across different pages.

## Default File
In a Next.js app directory structure, a `layout.tsx` (or `.jsx`) file is required at the root of each route segment. It acts as a wrapper for pages within that segment.

## Basic Example:
**`app/layout.tsx`**
```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <header>My Site Header</header>
        {children}
        <footer>My Site Footer</footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Nested Layouts
Each folder under the `app` directory can have its own `layout.tsx` file. These are automatically composed by Next.js.

**Example Directory Structure:**
```plaintext
app
  ├── layout.tsx        ← Root layout
  └── dashboard
      ├── layout.tsx    ← Dashboard-specific layout
      └── page.tsx      ← Page using both root + dashboard layouts
```

## Multiple Root Layouts

In larger projects, you might want to have **multiple root-level layouts** to serve different parts of your app—such as a marketing site and a dashboard.

To achieve this, you can separate sections using **route groups**:

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
app
  ├── (marketing)
  │   ├── layout.tsx      ← Layout for marketing pages
  │   └── home
  │       └── page.tsx
  ├── (dashboard)
  │   ├── layout.tsx      ← Layout for dashboard pages
  │   └── analytics
  │       └── page.tsx
```

Now each section has its own root layout that wraps all its pages. This provides flexibility in design and functionality.

## Shared Layouts with Routing
Layouts persist when navigating between sibling routes, enabling smoother transitions and better performance.

---

## Best Practices
- Use `layout.tsx` for static UI components (headers, navs, sidebars).
- Avoid placing heavy logic or stateful components directly in layouts.
- Keep layout components lightweight and reusable.

---

## Summary
- Layouts allow you to maintain consistent structure across your app.
- Every segment can have its own layout.
- They're composed automatically by Next.js.
- Great for maintaining UX consistency.
